## 📌 Key Components
- ⚙️ **StorageManager Class** – Handles local storage with compression, cleanup & error handling.  
- 🌍 **Dynamic Dropdowns** – State, district, and pincode selection based on Indian datasets.  
- ✅ **Form Validation** – Ensures data integrity (password matching, duplicate check, required fields).  
- 📡 **Geolocation API** – Captures live coordinates with placeholder map integration.  
- 🔎 **Search Module** – Filters donors by blood group & location with clean result display.  

---

## 📊 Data Management
- **Local Storage:** User & donor data stored with prefixes (`bloodconnect_user_`, `bloodconnect_donor_`).  
- **Storage Limit:** 10MB cap with cleanup to prevent overflows.  
- **Compression:** Data is compressed before storage for efficiency.  

---

## 📱 Responsive Design
- Uses **CSS Grid** and **media queries** for adaptive layouts.  
- Optimized for both **desktop and mobile** screens.  
- Hidden UI elements (landing images, auth panel) on small devices for performance.  
- **Typography:** Inter font + CSS variables for consistency.  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Depends on **browser local storage** (not ideal for large-scale use).  
- Map is a **static placeholder**, not a real mapping service.  
- **No backend** – purely client-side app (no persistent authentication).  
- Limited **pincode dataset** (may not cover all areas).  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Backend integration (Firebase / MongoDB) for persistent storage & authentication.  
- Real mapping service integration (Google Maps / OpenStreetMap).  
- Advanced search filters (e.g., proximity radius, last donation date).  
- Stronger security (password hashing, secure uploads).  
- Expanded location & pincode datasets.
