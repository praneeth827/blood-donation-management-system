Donor Search: Location-based search for compatible blood donors using blood type, state, and district filters.

Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring accessibility on mobile and desktop devices.

Local Storage Management: Efficient data storage with compression and cleanup mechanisms to handle storage limits.

Interactive UI: Modern design with modal feedback, smooth transitions, and a visually appealing layout.

Navigate to the project directory:

cd BloodConnect

Open index.html in a web browser to run the application locally. No additional server setup is required as it uses client-side JavaScript and local storage.

Usage

Landing Page: Users are greeted with a visually engaging landing page that introduces BloodConnect and provides options to sign up or sign in.

Sign Up: Create an account by providing first name, last name, email, and password. Passwords must be at least 6 characters long and match the confirmation field.

Sign In: Existing users can log in using their email and password.

Role Selection: After signing in, users choose between registering as a donor or searching for donors.





Donor Registration:

Fill out personal details, contact information, and medical data (blood group, blood percentage).

Select location details (state, district, pincode) and optionally provide Aadhaar proof.

Use the geolocation feature to capture live coordinates.

Donor Search: Specify blood type, state, and district to find compatible donors. Results are displayed with detailed donor information.

Feedback: Modal windows provide feedback on actions like successful registration or errors.

Key Components

StorageManager Class: Handles local storage with compression, cleanup, and error handling to manage user and donor data efficiently.

Dynamic Dropdowns: Populates state, district, and pincode dropdowns based on a predefined dataset of Indian states and districts.

Form Validation: Ensures data integrity with checks for password matching, duplicate entries, and required fields.

Geolocation: Integrates the browser's geolocation API to capture and display user coordinates with a visual map placeholder.

Search Functionality: Filters donors based on blood type and location, displaying results in a clean, organized format.

Data Management

Local Storage: User and donor data are stored in the browser's local storage with a prefix (bloodconnect_user_ and bloodconnect_donor_) for organization.

Storage Limits: The system enforces a 10MB storage cap and includes cleanup mechanisms to remove old entries when storage is full.

Compression: Data is compressed before storage to optimize space usage.

Responsive Design

Mobile-Friendly: The layout adapts to screen sizes using CSS Grid, media queries, and flexible units (rem, vw, vh).

Hidden Elements: Certain sections (e.g., landing page images, auth left panel) are hidden on smaller screens to improve performance and usability.

Typography: Uses CSS variables for consistent font sizes and the Inter font for readability.

Limitations

Local Storage Dependency: Data persistence relies on browser storage, which may not be suitable for large-scale applications.

Mock Map: The map display is a placeholder with a static grid and marker, not a real mapping service.

No Backend: The current version is client-side only, lacking server-side storage or authentication.

Limited Pincode Data: The pincode dataset is simplified and may not cover all possible pincodes.

Future Enhancements

Integrate a backend database (e.g., Firebase, MongoDB) for persistent storage and user authentication.

Implement a real mapping service (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap) for accurate location visualization.

Add advanced search filters (e.g., proximity radius, last donation date).

Enhance security with password hashing and secure file uploads.

Expand the dataset to include more comprehensive pincode and location information.
